ðŸš¨ CRITICAL BUGFIX: Photo Category Domain Separation

Fixed major bug where photos uploaded in Return tab were showing in Handover tab due to shared field references.

âœ… Fixed Issues:
- Separated handover_photo_ids and return_photo_ids fields completely
- Each upload widget now has unique context to set correct photo type
- Display galleries now use dedicated fields instead of filtered attachment_ids
- Photo comparison view updated to use separated fields

ðŸ”§ Technical Changes:
- handover_photo_ids field now used exclusively for handover photos
- return_photo_ids field now used exclusively for return photos
- Unique context values prevent photo type mixing
- Eliminated domain conflicts between photo categories
- Proper field separation ensures photos appear in correct tabs

ðŸŽ¯ Result:
- Photos uploaded in Handover tab stay in Handover gallery
- Photos uploaded in Return tab stay in Return gallery
- No more cross-contamination between photo categories
- Clean separation of photo workflows
