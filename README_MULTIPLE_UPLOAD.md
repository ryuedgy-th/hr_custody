- Total size (max 100MB per batch)
- File count (max 20 files)
```

#### **Workflow Integration**

- **Edge** ‚úÖ

### Performance Notes
- Uses **client-side image processing** for speed
- **Asynchronous upload** prevents browser freezing
- **Memory efficient** - processes one file at a time
- **Network optimized** - validates before sending

### Migration from Single Upload
- **Existing single upload** buttons still work
- **No data migration needed**
- **Backward compatible** with existing workflows
- **New buttons added** alongside existing ones

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues:
1. **"Upload zone not responding"**
   - Check browser JavaScript is enabled
